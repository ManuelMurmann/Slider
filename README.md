# Slider
Simple slider with not much functionality

This slider is still very much work in progress

I built this slider because when i tried libraries for sliders i thought they were really confusing and i needed the training.

What it can do:
- You can decide how many slides you want to show at a time
- You can decide how many slides you want to scroll at a time
- It works for touchscreens and snaps to the most centered slide
- It has radio buttons which can also be used for scrolling
- Infinite scrolling, it snaps back to the first / last slide when reaching the last / first slide
- Radio buttons are created automatically 

What i plan on doing:
- Make the javascript look better and show your options easier
- Make it draggable for desktops
- Change the entire code because its not good looking at all
- Add a blur to the both sides of the slider so the slides dont just disappear
