# Slider
Simple slider with not very much functionality

I built this slider because when i tried libraries for sliders i thought they were really confusing and i needed the training.

What it can do:
- You can decide how many slides you want to show at a time
- You can decide how many slides you want to scroll at a time
- It works for touchscreens and snaps to the most centered slide
- It has radio buttons which can also be used for scrolling

What i plan on doing:
- Create the radio buttons with Javascript so your slider can be as long as you want it to be
- Make the javascript look better and show your options easier
- Use javascript to change how many slides to show at a time because you currently have to change that yourself in css and edit the javascript as well
- Make it draggable for desktops
- Change the entire code because its not good looking at all
